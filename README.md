# Game Library

This is a practice project for improving skills with React. This project will reinforce the basic fundamentals of React and leverage the following concepts and ideas:

-   Components
-   Props
-   JSX
-   useState
-   Events
-   Forms w/ Controlled Components
-   Component Composition
-   useEffect
-   useRef
-   Custom Hooks

This project intentionally avoids using the Context API or any state management library. I may come back to this and re-work it into a v2 that uses these concepts later on.
