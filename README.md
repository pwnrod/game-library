# Game Library Project

This is a practice project for creating a browsable directory of video games with React. The focus for v1 of this project is on React basics. The scope of React functionality covered in this project is:

-   Components
-   Props
-   JSX
-   useState
-   Events
-   Forms w/ Controlled Components
-   Component Composition
-   useEffect
-   useRef
-   Custom Hooks

This project intentionally avoids using the Context API or any state management library. I may come back to this and re-work it into a v2 that uses these concepts later on.
